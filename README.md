# Predicting-One-Year-Overall-Survival-in-Patients-with-AITL
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a high-risk hematological malignancy, and patients with poor prognosis, especially those with an expected survival time of less than 1 year, derive little benefit from traditional treatments. To address this, the present study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning-based predictive model for the accurate assessment of 1-year overall survival (OS) in AITL patients. After comparing and screening multiple algorithms, the CatBoost algorithm was ultimately selected, and a total of 8 core features were incorporated, including Age, B symptom, ECOG score, Rash, Edema/Serous effusion, hemoglobin (Hb), platelet count (PLT), and albumin (ALB), to construct the final model for predicting 1-year survival in AITL patients.
