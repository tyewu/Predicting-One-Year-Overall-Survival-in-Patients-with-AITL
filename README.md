# Predicting-One-Year-Overall-Survival-in-Patients-with-AITL
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a high-risk hematological malignancy. Poor-prognosis patients (survival &lt;1 year) gain little from traditional treatments. This study develops an interpretable ML model for 1-year OS prediction, selecting CatBoost with 8 core features: Age, B symptom, ECOG, Rash, Edema, Hb, PLT, ALB.
